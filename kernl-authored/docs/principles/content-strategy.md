## Overview

A user-centered content strategy concerns itself with the vision—the ins and outs of how and why your content will be created and maintained with the end user in mind.

## Value Proposition
<p class="fs--lead">What inspires your audience to engage?</p>

Three ways to determine this is found within the _why_, _what_ and _who_. Once you’re done answering these questions, you should be ready to create the necessary content to achieve the project goals.

<div class="row pt--1h">
    <div class="col w--1/3@w fs--sm">
        <h5>Why is this important?</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Why do your products/services matter?</li>
            <li>Why do you do what you do?</li>
            <li>What are you passionate about?</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="col w--1/3@w fs--sm">
        <h5>What do you do?</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>What problem(s) are you trying to solve?</li>
            <li>What is it that you do to solve that problem?</li>
            <li>How do you differ from your competitors?</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="col w--1/3@w fs--sm">
        <h5>Who is this for?</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Who are you trying to reach?</li>
            <li>What do they currently think about you?</li>
            <li>What is the most persuasive idea we can convey?</li>
        </ul>

## Clarity

<p class="fs--lead">Make information easy to find and understand.</p>

Try and keep your messaging short and to the point, your users are at the site to get something done, not to read paragraph after paragraph. Over-explanation gets in the way of people digesting meaning and moving quickly to the deeper content — the reason why they are at the site in first place.

## Voice

<p class="fs--lead">Tailor language and tone to your audience.</p>

By knowing your audience, the people with whom you want to be engaged, you can tailor the language and tone to them. Using this approach consistently in your content is known as <i>voice</i>.

+ Use words in a more conversational manner.
+ Avoid overly long page titles that are jargon-heavy.
+ Look to use concise statements in layman’s terms whenever possible.
+ If you need to use more in depth, peer-to-peer language, think about creating support articles to convey that information.
