## Protecting a page

Every page, post, or other post type can be secured. Simply scroll to the bottom of the page you wish to protect with SSO. Select the *Subscriber* checkbox within the "Content Permissions" section. While you can leverage Wordpress's powerful [roles and capabilities](https://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities) to create a number of hierarchies to protect pages, for basic instances, it is recommended to exclusively use the *Subscriber* role.

A user authenticates through the universal login system and, if successful, is redirected back to view the previous page. They now have access to the protected content for the remainder of their browser's session.
