# Posts

In Wordpress, a <i>post</i> is dynamic content that can be organized by taxonomies (i.e. categories, tags, etc) and by date. They can be useful building blocks when pulled into various views (e.g. archives, lists, calendars, etc).


## Banner
Posts can be as simple as a title and body copy (such as a blog post or news article), or can be customized to suit a specific need.

Some of the unique features of the post are their hierarchal taxonomies, featured images and ability to be displayed as a [card](/ui/components/cards.html).

<ImageStage title="Admin View" filename="posts.jpg" caption="Featured images will appear on the Card componet of the post." />

<ImageStage title="Live View" filename="posts-live.jpg" caption="" />

## Taxonomy
Posts can be <i>categorized</i> and <i>tagged</i> for easy filtering and sorting. A category is name given to a broad group of posts. Tags describe specific details of your posts.

<ImageStage title="Live View" filename="post-cat-tax-live.png" caption="The catagory of the post will be displayed above the Title of the post" />
