# Pages

In Wordpress, a <i>page</i> typically displays static, single-use content.


## Banner and Layouts
Pages can be as simple as a title and body copy (such as an about page or contact page), or can be customized to handle very complex content, layouts, and data presentation. For basic instructions on layouts, please [read the layouts explanation](wp/layouts/overview.html)

::: tip
For complex layouts, please reach out to [*provost-digital@northeastern.edu*](mailto:provost-digital@northeastern.edu) for the initial setup.

## Hierarchy
Pages work as both stand alone items or as a grouping of parent/child pages. Often we employ a parent for a landing page which would cover overall themes and messaging relevant to the topic. Child pages would them be nested under the parent page.

<ImageStage title="Admin Single Page View" filename="pages-parent-child.png" caption="You can select which parent you want the page to belong to under 'Page Attributes'" />

## Side Navigation
If a hierarchy is created, a side navigation is automatically created in the left margin of your page and will reflect the defined relationships.

### Ordering
You can customize the order of your pages in the side navigation by dragging and dropping pages in the menu view (this will adjust a page's menu order field).
