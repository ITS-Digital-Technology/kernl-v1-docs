# Typography

Typography is the system of font sizes and weights to establish a logical flow and hierarchy for your content.

## Overview

At its most basic level, a site’s content should be effective and persuasive with only text &mdash; images, animations and other graphics are there to _support_ that content, not supplant it. Therefore, clear and consistent headings, highly legible body paragraphs, clear labels and sentence length are critical. To ensure a clean typographic system, we suggest the following basic guidelines.

## Hierarchy
 
<p class="fs--lead">Hierarchy signifies importance by structuring something based on its inherent importance.</p>

Users should be able to scan content and identify the differences quickly. Clearly define information with headings, list groups, blockquotes, and assorted display faces to signal a change from one level of content to another. 

+ Organize your content thoughtfully by breaking it into sections with appropriate headings.
+ Position the most valuable information first, and cascade to secondary or tertiary info from there.
+ Try to use weights and sizes that are not too close to one another.

## Contrast

<p class="fs--lead">Items with a higher contrast to their surroundings are recognized first.</p>

Don’t assign every item with the same weight or size &mdash; this will defeat the purpose. Rather, define the relationship of the content first, and assign weights that properly represent them. Clear differences between content will help users navigate your site.

## Scale

<p class="fs--lead">Scale works in concert with contrast.</p>

Whereas contrast helps define both readability and scanability of your content, consistency in sizing across elements maintains consistency and promotes a better user experience. A visual type scale is baked into all our templates to help you create sites that adhere to best web practice standards.

| Element | Example |
| ------- | ------- |
| h1      | <h1>Heading 1</h1> |
| h2      | <h2>Heading 2</h2> |
| h3      | <h3>Heading 3</h3> |
| h4      | <h4>Heading 4</h4> |
| h5      | <h5>Heading 5</h5> |
| h6      | <h6>Heading 6</h6> |
| p, li, td | <p>Paragraph, List Item, Table Cell</p> |
