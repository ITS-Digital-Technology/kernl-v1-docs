# Banner

A page's title will appear in the template's <i>banner</i>. In addition to the title, a banner can include a pretitle and/or a subtitle.

## Overview
When you create a new page or post, the banner is pre populated with the title. The banner area can also have both a pre title and subtitle for added contextual information. This can be very helpful on large websites with multiple pages.

The banner can also be customized with images, background colors and more advance options.

## Add Titles
Click "Add Titles" to override the page title, and add a pretitle and/or subtitle.

<ImageStage title="Live View" filename="banner-2-live.png" caption="The section title and page content. See Layouts section for more." />

## Customize Styles
Click on "Customize Styles" to active the visual options of the banner. Note the background color will default to black, which is recommended unless you want to add an image.

### Overlay Masthead
Toggle the "Overlay Masthead" switch to have the banner image extend behind the masthead. We recomend only using this for article posts.

You can also extend the height of the banner to show more of the image. Select "Height:XXvh" from the options dropdown.
