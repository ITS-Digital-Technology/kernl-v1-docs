# Accessbility

kernl(wp) has number of helpful accessibility features baked-in with a minimum setup or advanced knowledge.

## Template functionality

kernl(wp) is built to meet the four main principles of web accessibility as defined in [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) by the W3C: Perceivable Operable, Understandable, Robust.

The following considerations are already built in to the kernl() ecosystem:

* All HTML markup is composed semantically, allowing various technologies to interpret the structure of a page.
* The first element in the markup is a ‘skip to nav’ function.
* ARIA roles are applied appropriately to high-level structural elements (banner, navigation, main, contentinfo, etc)
* It is perceivable across multiple devices; screen widths from mobile phone to widescreen, as well as assistive technologies like screen readers.

## Editorial responsibility
